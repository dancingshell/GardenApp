  [:Full_Sun "Full sun is commonly defined as direct sunlight for at least 6 hours during the middle part of the day during the growing season. If you’re lucky enough to have a sunny site, you’ll have a large selection of plants from which to choose, since a majority of the most common perennials perform best in full sun. (Many of these plants will survive in partial shade, but the display of flowers may not be as dramatic.) The exception to this is for gardeners in hot, dry regions, who should consider locating their gardens in a place where the plants will receive some shade during the hottest part of the day."],

  [:Partial_Shade => "Trees account for 25 percent of the canopy, and the plants receive 5 to 10 hours of sun. In the home landscape this is generally just under the drip line of trees (the outermost extension of the canopy)."],

  [:Full_Shade => "Full shade means the garden should receive less than 1 hour of direct sun, although filtered light may be present occasionally. This could be under a dense deciduous tree, close to the trunk."],
  [:Deep_Shade => "Deep shade occurs where the sun doesn’t reach the ground, such as in a coniferous forest or in a yard where the sun is blocked out by structures such as walls and overhangs."]
